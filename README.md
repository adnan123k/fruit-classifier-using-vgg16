# fruit-classifier-using-vgg16
our model could know which fruit is which using the pre-trained model but choping it's heads off to train on fruits 360 dataset.
# how to run it
there is two ways to use it:<br/>
1-colab<br/>
2-locally<br/>
if you're using colab just upload the ipynb file and run it<br/>
locally:<br/>
1-you have to install python 3<br/>
2-the recommended libraries<br/>
3-install ide and open the .py file or .ipynb<br/>
4-run it

# the recommended libraries:
1-tensorflow<br/>
2-keras<br/>
3-glob<br/>
4-matplotlib
